  About Me:
</h2>
<div>
  Okay, if someone is really reading this, my name is IgorüôÉ, I'm a developer from Russia.</br>
  I mainly do mobile development, my main languages are <strong>Kotlin</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>. I also write in <strong>Swift</strong>, <strong>C#</strong>, </strong>ReactJs</strong>.
</br></br>
 <strong>Programming is now my life</strong>, what I do every day and what brings me great pleasure. For all the time I managed to try myself in different languages and projects. Learning new languages or technologies is always very interesting and <strong>I'm always happy to try my hand at something else</strong>.
</br></br>
My journey began in 2015 with the <strong>C#</strong> language and the <strong>Unity3D</strong> game engine, at that time I was engaged in graphic design, took orders for the development of mobile and web design, and experimented in my free time in jvizhka. I wrote simple <strong>.NET applications for Windows</strong>, but at some point I decided to try <strong>Java</strong>, it dragged me out for a very long timeüëÄ
</br>
I originally started learning Java from <strong>Katie Sierra and Bert Beist's "Learning Java"üëç</strong> book, which helped me quickly get into <strong>Java</strong> app development and <strong>Android</strong> app development, then switched to <strong>Kotlin</strong>, which is now my main programming language. I also started to study <strong>Swift</strong> for the sake of interest, I can‚Äôt say that I can write fluently in it, but I really like the language and I plan to study it further.
</br>
