  About Me:
</h2>

Mobile developer with over 5 years of commercial experience, specializing in Android development using Kotlin. I have contributed to the development of large-scale multi-module applications and created custom low-level solutions such as a streaming video player and a WebSocket library. I pay particular attention to UI and animations.

For over 10 years, I have also worked as a freelance graphic designer, which helps me implement complex interfaces, thoughtful animations, and visual effects.

Iâ€™m an advocate of clean architecture, readable code, and continuous professional growth. In my projects, I actively use modern development practices, build internal tools and libraries, and share knowledge with the team.
