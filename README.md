  About Me:
</h2>

Mobile developer with over 3 years of experience. I have experience working with Android and iOS platforms. My profile is focused on mobile application development for the Android platform, as well as working with graphics programs. I started my path in programming at the age of 13 and since then have continuously improved my skills and expanded my knowledge in the field of development. I specialize in programming languages Kotlin, Java, C#, and also have experience working with React Js, C++, and Swift.

I strive to maintain high performance and quality of my projects, using new technologies and development methods. My technology stack includes:

- Libraries for HTTP requests - ktor and retrofit;
- For asynchronous programming, I use kotlin coroutine and flow
- For DI, I use dagger hilt or kodein;
- I prefer custom view for UI implementation, learning jetpack compose, and of course, XML;
- Worked with architectural patterns - MVVM, Moxy MVP, MVC;
- Used room and data storage for local data storage;
- Have experience working with cross-platform KMM, React Native;
- I also have experience working with RxJava, Firebase SDK, Vk SDK, and Telegram SDK.
- Since the main repository storage service is bitbucket, my github is not very active. I mainly leave projects there that were made for testing some new libraries, methods, etc.

I am always ready for new challenges and strive for development as a specialist in my field. I constantly learn new technologies and development methods, and often create my own projects to try something new. I am confident that my experience, knowledge, and professionalism can make me a valuable addition to any software development team..
