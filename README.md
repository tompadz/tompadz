  About Me:
</h2>
<div>
  Okay, if someone is really reading this, my name is IgorðŸ™ƒ, I'm a developer from Russia.</br>
  I mainly do mobile development, my main languages are <strong>Kotlin</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>. I also write in <strong>Swift</strong>, <strong>C#</strong>
</br></br>
 <strong>Programming is now my life</strong>, what I do every day and what brings me great pleasure. For all the time I managed to try myself in different languages and projects. Learning new languages or technologies is always very interesting and <strong>I'm always happy to try my hand at something else</strong>.
